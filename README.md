Some autoform actions wait for the server.  This can make an offline app that has grounded collections unresponsive when the internet connection is lost.

This package addresses some the most common problems I've encountered while making an offline app

**Installation**

`meteor add anthonyastige::ground-autoform`

That's it.  The hooks should automatically ground your autoforms.
